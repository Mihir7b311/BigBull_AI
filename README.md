## 🌟 Introduction

AI is booming, and we want AI to **make money for everyone**. That’s why we created **BigBull.ai** – an AI-powered trading platform that enables users to **fund an AI agent and let it trade on their behalf** with **optimized strategies**.

Our key focus is on **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)**, allowing users to enter and exit markets at the right time, making **consistent profits** while minimizing risk.

## 🚀 Features & Trading Strategies

BigBull.ai leverages advanced **AI-driven trading techniques** and **machine learning models** to make intelligent trading decisions. Here’s what we offer:

### 📈 **Technical Indicator-Based Trading**
- **Moving Averages (SMA & EMA):** Detects short-term and long-term trend reversals.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Identifies overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands:** Measures price volatility and helps identify breakout opportunities.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** Tracks momentum shifts for trend-following trades.
- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):** Ensures trades align with market liquidity trends.

### 📊 **Momentum & Trend-Following Strategies**
- **Moving Average Crossover Strategy:** Buy signal when short-term EMA crosses above long-term EMA, sell on the opposite.
- **Ichimoku Cloud Strategy:** Identifies strong bullish/bearish trends based on cloud analysis.

### 🔄 **Mean Reversion Strategies**
- **RSI-Based Mean Reversion:** Buy when RSI < 30, sell when RSI > 70.
- **Bollinger Bands Reversion:** Buy at lower band, sell at upper band.

### 💥 **Breakout Trading**
- **Support & Resistance Breakout:** Trades execute when the price breaks above resistance or below support.
- **Volume-Confirmed Breakouts:** Breakouts with high volume indicate stronger price movements.

### 🧠 **Machine Learning-Based Trading**
- **Regression Models (Random Forest, XGBoost):** Predicts short-term price movements.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Forecasts future price sequences.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** AI agent dynamically adjusts trade execution for maximum returns.

## 🔍 Backtesting & Strategy Evaluation
Before deploying, all strategies undergo rigorous **backtesting using historical STRK/USDT data**:
- **Simulated Trading:** Testing strategies against past market conditions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluating returns, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and win rate.
- **Risk Analysis:** Optimizing strategies to minimize losses and maximize gains.

---

## ⚡ Live Trading & Automation
BigBull.ai integrates seamlessly with major crypto exchanges for **real-time execution**:
- **Exchange API Integration:** Fetching live data from Binance & OKX APIs.
- **WebSocket Streams:** Enabling real-time trade execution.
- **Risk Management:** Includes stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing rules.
- **Dynamic Strategy Optimization:** AI-based parameter tuning based on past performance.
